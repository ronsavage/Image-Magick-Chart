- Image::Magick's Draw() method has an option 'fill'. When I first wrote this module
fill's value defaulted to 'none' and now it defaults to something else. The effect is
that when drawing a frame the whole image is now filled in with black. Hence the patch
to Image::Magick::Chart's draw_frame() method.
I am tempted to rant and rave about the endless butchering of Image::Magick by its author
but that would not achieve anything... And anyway it's an extremely useful module

- Add an option y_axis_labels_x which allows the user to specify the x-axis value
(abscissa) at which to start writing y-axis labels. From the POD:
The value if not undef determines the x-axis value (abscissa) at which y-axis labels are written.
The special value undef means this module calculates an abscissa at which to start writing
y-axis labels. The default behaviour is identical to the previous version 1.01.
This calculation will only produce a pretty-looking column of y-axis labels when all labels are
the same width in pixels. See C<sub draw_y_axis_labels()> for the calculation.
The default value is undef.
This parameter is optional.
